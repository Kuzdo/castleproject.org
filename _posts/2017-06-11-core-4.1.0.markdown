Castle Core 4.1.0 is now available. This release includes the following changes since 4.0.0:

- Upgrade to log4net 2.0.8 (@fir3pho3nixx, #241)
- New `ProxyUtil.IsAccessible` API to check if a method is accessible to DynamicProxyGenAssembly2 (Blair Conrad, #235)
- Fix order of class proxy constructor arguments when using multiple mixins (@sebastienros, #230)
- Fix dependency on `System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter` NuGet package version that does not exist (#239)
- Fix `ParamArrayAttribute` not being replicated in proxy (@stakx, #121)
- Fix `System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient` is obsolete on Mono warning (#254)

And this release is now driven by the new .NET build tooling rather than a mix of both, and new CI automation with
many thanks to @fir3pho3nixx.

See [GitHub][github-release] for the release notes.

Castle Windsor 3.4.0 release is out. It has been a long time since the last Windsor release so this release provides a
rollup of several fixes:

- Fix case sensitivity issue that can cause UsingFactoryMethod to fail (@dohansen, #116)
- Fix project and icon URLs in NuGet packages
- Add PDB source indexing (@ivan-danilov, #137)
- Fix unit test with weak reference broken by garbage collector changes in .NET 4.6.x (@ivan-danilov, #138)
- Fix performance counter instances hanging around after the process using Windsor has ended (@mackenzieajudd, #146, #149)
- Fix version of Castle.Core dependency in NuGet packages to indicate Castle.Core 4.0 is incompatible (#161)

Thanks to everyone who contributed documentation changes since the last release and also those that fixed the defects
above. See [GitHub][github-release] for full details.

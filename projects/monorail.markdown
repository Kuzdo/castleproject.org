## MonoRail 3
MonoRail's 3 goal is based on our experience and perception of the "state of the union" and trends. If we could put them in three simple statements:

* We are mentally tired of crafting web sites despite huge functionality overlaps (combine/compose).
* We are tired of REST being an afterthought to existing websites (rest support from the beginning).
* We tired of frameworks created by people without *actual* website building experience (frictionless).

The goals/roadmap/value-proposition [were discussed][mr3-goals] in the past in our development list:

* Since our underlying runtime (CLR) is keen on static typing then fully embrace it
* Move forward: embrace HTML5
* Simplify special render for different form factors
* Strive for simplicity, but no simpler

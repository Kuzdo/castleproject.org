We are a bunch of programmers who share a collective frustration with the *status quo* of the development tools and frameworks for .net. We have jobs, lives and hobbies, and we value being productive. We also value delivering software that is maintainable and long lasting.

**That was the motivation for this open source project.**

**Castle Project** is an umbrella for a handful of [**open source**][wikipedia-oss] projects for .net. We aspire to simplify the development of enterprise and/or web applications.

**Castle** helps you get more done with less code and in less time (but not in the traditional code generator mess that some preach).

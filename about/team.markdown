## Emeritus
When committers or PMC members who have contributed to the Castle Project become inactive, we want to make sure that we acknowledge their contributions. A committer or PMC member may be placed on emeritus status, this is an honorary position for those who were formerly active in the community but have retired from the Castle Project. These committers do not have commit access to the repositories and these PMC members do not having a binding PMC vote ([&sect;4.2 Emeritus Members](https://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html)).

The decision to place a committer or PMC member on emeritus status is either by request, or by majority vote of the PMC. If you have not participated in code reviews or contributed to the Castle Project within the past six months an automatic recommendation for emeritus status may be put forward to the PMC. An emeritus committer may request to be reinstated, such reinstatement is subject to the normal committer PMC majority vote.

Our thanks to each of these people and their contributions to the long term success of the Castle Project.
